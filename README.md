Repo for my Semester Project: Self-supervised vegetation height refinement on satellite and segmentation images.

It features the implementation of a custom loss function Rank-Sim (github.com/BorealisAI/ranksim-imbalanced-regression) applied on PixTransform model (github.com/prs-eth/PixTransform).

Also a quick preview and processing of the data is demonstrated in the notebook.

See the report for details.
